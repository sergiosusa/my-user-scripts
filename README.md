# My User Scripts

A users scripts' collection created by me. All scripts are written on javascript language and need some browser extension to work.

## Prerequisites

- [Tampermonkey (Chrome)](https://tampermonkey.net)
- [Greasemonkey (Firefox)](http://www.greasespot.net)
- [Violent monkey (Opera)](https://addons.opera.com/sk/extensions/details/violent-monkey/)

## Installation

**Github**

- Enter to the user script file (usually named as <code>*.user.js</code>) you want to install.
- Click on the <code>Raw</code> button, the browser extension will recognize this file as a user script.
- Install it.

That's it!
